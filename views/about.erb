  <p>Cancer has changed my life in a way that impacted my future and reshaped my purpose. I was directly impacted by family members dealing with the disease, just as so many of us have been. Shortly after dealing with both of my grandparents battles, my very dear friends lost their son, Baby K, to cancer as well. I soon became overwhelmed with passion to do what I could to help the big fight.</p>
  <p>The fight against cancer begins with a diagnosis that is often frightening and overwhelming. In addition to maintaining the physical and mental strength needed to endure the fight, so many concerns and worries accompany the illness. The financial stress can be daunting. Many lose their income, insurance, ability to work, and even their homes in the process of fighting this illness or caring for a loved one who is. It really is a team effort to get through these situations and of course there are also those left to fight alone.</p>
  <p>Our Fight for Life fundraiser signifies the importance of the fight of cancer.  My mission and passion lie strongly in helping those here in our own community with the difficulties that may come about during such times. Every dime raised for Fight for Life will stay here in our community to assist those from our neighborhood that  may need treatment here or elsewhere.  Each person I have had the pleasure to meet and help in his or her fight is important. It is my sincere desire that as a community we can help even more. This is a fight we all need to embrace so no one has to go through it alone and without the love and support that a family and community such as ours can generate.</p>
  <p>Fight for Life would not be possible if it were not for amazing people and you, our community partners, who have supported our past fundraising efforts. We hope that you join us in our Fight for Life to make a positive difference to those whose lives are directly impacted by this disease.</p>
